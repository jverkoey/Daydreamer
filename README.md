# Daydreamer

A native Figma client for iPad, created exclusively using Swift Playgrounds on an iPad Pro + Magic Keyboard.

This is a work in progress, proof of concept idea resulting from my personal laptop dying while on
vacation, leaving me only with my iPad Pro + Magic Keyboard. Every aspect of this project has been created
exclusively using an iPad. No laptop or desktop computer was involved. I did make use of a cloud linux box for diagnosing some Swift package errors, but otherwise all building, testing, and debugging of the app has happened directly on my iPad.
